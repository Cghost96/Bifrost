# Bifrost
This is an interactive application and rendering engine which I will build from scratch following the Hazel engine tutorials. Bifrost will pretty much be an exact replica of the Hazel engine. The repository for Hazel can be found at https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel and the tutorials can be found at https://thecherno.com/engine.
